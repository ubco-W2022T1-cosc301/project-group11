The dataset selected for this project is created by Sumaia P. and is posted on Kaggle. The data collection lists Vancouver's historical crime data from 2003 to 2021. The table shows the type of crime, the year, month, date, hour, and minute that they occurred, the location (hundred block) and neighborhood of the crime scene, and the x and y coordinate values projected in UTM zone 10. This collection has been released to the public by the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) with the intention of enhancing community awareness of policing activities in the city. The data provided is based on the information contained in the VPD Records Management System. Unfortunately, there is no information on how the data was collected. Still, it can be speculated that the values are based on historical records that have been digitized, as the historical crime data of past years are likely archived into a dataset such as this.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We are very interested to find out the historical crime trends in Vancouver, as it is a city we visit often, and some of us are even planning to move there in the future. By gaining more awareness, we will be able to be more prepared to avoid encountering these crimes. The crime data will also likely be a valuable reference for the police department of Vancouver to predict crimes that may occur in the future and prepare means to handle them better.

Some questions that we would like to explore are:

- What is the most common type of crime overall and in each area?
- At what times do the crimes occur the most?
- Which years had the most criminal cases, and why is it so?
- Which areas are the most targeted? (eg. residential areas, business districts, parking lots, etc.)
- The frequency of crime rates vs the area of occurrence in Vancouver can be plotted. What does it look like on the city map?
